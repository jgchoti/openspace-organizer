#  A table

# We define a table with how many seats it encompasses and we define the object in the `table.py` file

# ##### 1.1 Seat

# In `table.py`:

# Create a class called `Seat` with two attributes:

# - `free` which is a boolean.
# - `occupant` which is a string.

# and 2 functions : 

# - `set_occupant(name)` which allows the program to assign someone a seat if it's free
# - `remove_occupant()` which  remove someone from a seat and return the name of the person occupying the seat before
