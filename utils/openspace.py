# 2. An openspace

# In `openspace.py` create a class `Openspace` that contains these attributes:

# - `tables` which is a list of `Table`. _(you will need to import `Table` from `table.py`)_. 
# - `number_of_tables` which is an integer.

# And some methods:

# - `organize(names)` that will:
#   - **randomly** assign people to `Seat` objects in the different `Table` objects.
# - `display()` display the different tables and there occupants in a nice and readable way
# - `store(filename)` store the repartition in an excel file
